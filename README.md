# Streaming-Data-Pipelines-with-Amazon-Data-Firehose-and-Snowpipe-Streaming

I recently had the opportunity to dive deep into a comprehensive lab focused on real-time data ingestion and analysis using Amazon Data Firehose (ADF) and Snowflake. This hands-on experience has been incredibly enlightening, providing me with valuable insights into the seamless integration of these powerful tools for real-time analytics.

**Key Takeaways:**

***1. Setting Up ADF Delivery Stream:***

*Navigated the ADF console to create a delivery stream with Snowflake as the destination.<br>
*Employed secure communication using Amazon PrivateLink, ensuring robust data governance and security.<br>
*Configured various settings such as the Snowflake account URL, user credentials, and private key management.<br>

***2.Data Ingestion and Querying in Snowflake:***

*Created a destination table in Snowflake to store the ingested data.<br>
*Utilized a Python script to stream real-time flight data into Snowflake.<br>
*Queried the raw data to verify successful ingestion and then transformed it into structured formats for more effective analysis.<br>

***3.Utilizing Snowflake Copilot:***

*Leveraged Snowflake Copilot, an LLM-powered assistant, to interact with data using natural language.<br>
*Asked complex analytical questions and received SQL commands to execute, simplifying the querying process and enhancing productivity.<br>

***4.Real-Time Analytics with Flink:***

*Integrated Apache Flink for real-time data processing, demonstrating its potential in various use cases such as fraud detection, sensor data processing, and supply chain optimization.<br>
*Deployed a Flink Studio notebook and configured Kinesis Data Streams for real-time analytics.<br>
*Filtered and monitored live flight data, showcasing the ability to process and analyze data streams in real-time.<br>

***5.Geospatial Data Analysis:***

*Employed Snowflakeâ€™s geo-spatial functions to calculate distances between flight locations and airports.<br>
*Created a view to transform raw data, converting timestamps to different time zones and generating geohashes for time-series visualization.<br>
*Calculated distances between airplanes and San Francisco Airport, demonstrating the practical application of geo-spatial analysis in real-time data scenarios.<br>

This lab has been a significant learning milestone, highlighting the power of combining AWS and Snowflake for efficient data streaming and real-time analytics. The experience has equipped me with practical skills and knowledge that I'm excited to apply to future projects. Exploring advanced use cases and building sleek dashboards for monitoring live data are next on my list.
